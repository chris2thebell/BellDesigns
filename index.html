                <i class="fab fa-google"></i> My wife and my experience working with Chris was incredible. He was able to take our ideas and build on them to get to an end result that made my wife happy and excited. Our basement was big and had alot of potential but he did a great job of guiding us through the process. His knowledge of codes and attitude to really make sure were able to design our basement was spot on. The customer service was impressive and if we have friends that are looking then Bell Designs LLC is the best recommendation we could give to anyone.
